# Univeristy Projects

Here are my 2 university applications (in one project) that I've made during my last semester

## 1) Employees

The meaning of this app is to add employees, pay them for work, fire them, and count their ages if needed

## 2) Letter recognition

The meaning of this app is to recognize a letter a user draws. The logic of this app is pretty simple, it has patterns for every character of the Cyrillic alphabet in the static/img folder and compares the user's picture with the patterns  pixel by pixel
